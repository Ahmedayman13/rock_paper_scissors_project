This is Rock, Paper, Scissors Game part of javascript foundation course of The Odin Project. I tried to do my best and implement all of what i have learned till now in it, in the beginning it seemed hard but by followin the rules of proplem solving and dividin it into samller tasks i got to finish it also I went back to previous lessons to refresh my memory on a few things.

Hope you like it !!!
